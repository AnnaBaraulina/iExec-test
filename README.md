## iExec Test Assignment for Junior Frontend Developer Position    

#### The project showcases a React application with user authentication via the MetaMask extension and features secure data protection using the @iexec/dataprotector library.  

### Challenges Encountered  
- **Gradient on Hover for a Button element:** 
- **Gradient Border:**  
- **Banner Animation:** 

### Planned Improvements  
- **Button Component Refactoring:** I aim to refactor the button components to create a single, reusable button component. This will streamline the codebase and ensure consistency across the application.  
- **Optimal Storage Solution:**Currently, the project utilizes localStorage for data storage. Moving forward, I plan to change it to more optimal storage solutions to enhance performance and security.  
- **Docker Integration:**Preparing the project for Docker deployment is on my agenda.
